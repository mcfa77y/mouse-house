Bulk/Individual experiment upload

 field file input
 - CytoRunContentsDATE (meta info for linking images to platemap)

 field file input
 ZIPPED with same file structure as cyto run
 - images dir (images)
  - sub images dir name changes according to CytoRunContentsDATE file
    - images
 
 field file inputs
 - platemap dir (CytoPlatemaps never changes)
  - platemaps
 
 Processing
  CRC 
    - file link image_dir/sub_image_dir/image to platemap
    - populate column heades with
      - experiment_date / platemap / cell_line / magnification / concentration


  platemap contains information on compounds
     - compound / well_id / target / concentration
    

------------------------------------------------------------
update name of images to use 
date - cell line - platemap_number - condition? (ex LPS, EDU, ___)
well_id - site_number - wave_length (1 of 4)

mapping file: map.json
[
  {
    image_name: file_000.tiff,
    date: YY-MM-DD,
    cell_line: CL,
    platemap_number: SP0####,
    condition: (LPS, EDU, ___),
    well_id: A01,
    site_number: [S1..]
    wave_length: [1..4]
  }
]

------------------------------------------------------------
Search over experiments for compund
table should have 
cell line / magnification/ experiments date / concentration /etc

it'll have buttons for view all from result select
that takes you to a new page VIEW_ALL_COMPOUNDS_FROM_EXPR

should be able to download all images from search query
stretch goal download images as pdf with meta info


------------------------------------------------------------
VIEW_ALL_COMPOUNDS_FROM_EXPR
the same as the card info w/o the grid table

------------------------------------------------------------
bulk upload plate map data
experiments have plate maps (1..N)
upload the plate infromation independent of experiments

so when creating an experiment we can select from previous
uploaded platemaps ( or upload new plate which in turn is
loaded to list of already uploaded platemaps)



------------------------------------------------------------
grid map is normalized and doesn't need to be uploaded everytime
we can do the same as platemaps

gridmap is not needed any more work on refactoring it out and remove input field
use general map for time being
